## mLab and MongoDB Set Up
* Follow the tutorial in the link above to set up mLab and MongoDB.
* MongoDB does not need to be installed

## Deployment on Local
Create a file ".env" in your project folder in the following format:
```
MONGODB_USER=dbuser
MONGODB_PASS=dbpassword
MONGODB_NAME=dbname
MONGODB_HOST=dbhosturl
MONGODB_PORT=dbport
```

* dbuser: database user created under the Users tab within the database on mLab
* dbpassword: the corresponding password (not your mLab password)
* dbmname: the name following the final '/' at the end of the MongoDB URI
* dbhosturl: the url between '@' and ':'
* dbport: the port number following  the host url

To deploy locally run the commands:
```
mvn clean install
heroku local
```
The local site can be found on http://localhost:4567/

# Deployment to Heroku
Go to your Heroku app and under the settings tab change the config vars with the same key/value pair as in the local .env set up above.

e.g. "MONGODB_USER" in Key field and "dbuser" in Value field.

Compile and deploy your web app with the following:
```
mvn compile; mvn package heroku:deploy
```
